<!-- Welcome -->
<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/drB0jSb.png" height="54px" />  Welcome!</h2>

I'm **Jo√£o Marcos** (he/him), a 22 years old rustacean from Brazil üáßüá∑.

This is my **OSS** profile, click [**here**](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/marcospb19/marcospb19/master/joao_resume.pdf) if you want my _**resum√©**_ instead. (TODO: update resum√©)

Topics I'm spending my _free time_ on:

- Cool CLI tools.
- Compilers and parsers.
- Collaborative text editors.
- Competitive programming and data structures.
- Game development.

<!-- Projects -->

<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/ekBkvJA.png" height="54px" />  My projects</h2>

### The ones people actually use:

<table style="max-width: 100%; white-space: nowrap;">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/ouch-org/ouch">Ouch (1.6k ‚≠êÔ∏è)</a></td>
    <td>ü¶Ä</td>
    <td>
       Arguably the best CLI tool for (de)compressing stuff. Shipped to Arch, Manjaro, Homebrew, and more.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/ouch-org/permissions">Permissions</a></td>
    <td>ü¶Ä</td>
    <td>
       A crate with 30k+ downloads to check for file permissions.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/holmgr/cargo-sweep">cargo-sweep</a></td>
    <td>ü¶Ä</td>
    <td>
      I've become the maintainer of <code>cargo-sweep</code>, a <code>target/</code> cleaning tool with around 200k downloads.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### The coolest ones (IMO):

<table style="max-width: 100%; white-space: nowrap;">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/marcospb19/dawctl">Dawctl</a></td>
    <td>ü¶Ä</td>
    <td>
       My Deathadder controller reverse-engineered from Razer's proprietary and closed-source software.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/saiintbrisson/marquito">Marquito</a></td>
    <td>ü¶Ä</td>
    <td>
       An HTTP/1.1 mini-server hand-written in Rust that can handle 90k+ requests per second.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Experiments on how to build a programming language:

1. [`lox`] - First hand-written Lexer, Parser, AST, and basic interpreter.
2. [`cocoa`] - With Lexer and Parser libs, more interpreter work.
3. [`sushi`] - Retrying `Cocoa` with good error reporting.
4. [`mini-c`] - My first tiny compiler! It _"works"_!

### More Rust projects:

- [`fs-tree`] - (Crate) A Tree representation of a filesystem directory, allows you to traverse branches while applying operations.
- [`blockfrost-rust`] - Blockfrost's SaaS Rust SDK.
- [`tila`] - A Xorg keylogger to collect metrics about how I type, to feed keyboard layout analyzers.
- [`dotao`] - Incomplete experiments with a Dotfiles Manager.

### C++
- [`icpc-training`] Some of the advanced algorithms I studied for ICPC.

### C
- [`projeto-itp`] - An interactive CLI relational database written in C.
- [`loadingnewyear`] - My first ever project, draws a colored year progress in the terminal.

### Misc
- [`dotfiles`] Personal dotfiles.

<!-- Random facts about me -->
<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/myYgqBu.png" height="54px" />  Random facts about me</h2>

1. I have 7 cats, in Brazil we say that cats have 7 lives instead of 9. üê±
2. My dream is to work on a cool open source text editor or programming language in the future.
3. If my name were to be translated, I'd be called "John Marks Pear Tree Heifer". üßê (wtf)
4. Aaaand I'd probably _beat your ass_ at _table tennis_ üèì.

<!-- Programming games I like -->
<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/Y65KVTs.png" height="54px" />  Games I like</h2>

Some programming/engineering games I recommend:

1. [`Factorio`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/) (factory building).
2. [`Logic World`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1054340/Logic_World/) (circuit building).
3. [`MHRD`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/576030/MHRD/) (build a computer).
4. [`Exapunks`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/716490/EXAPUNKS/) (robot scripting).
5. [`Shenzhen I/O`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/) (assembly).
6. [`TIS-100`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/) (very primitive assembly).

All games are Turing complete, but 3-6 all have script size limitations.

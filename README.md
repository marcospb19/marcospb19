Hi, my name is Jo√£o Marcos (he/him), I'm 19 and I'm from Brazil.

I'm an IT undergraduate and I plan on getting a major college degree by 2025 in Computer Science.

<!-- Studies -->
<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/ekBkvJA.png" height="54px" />  Studies</h2>

Here's a list of topics I like to study in free time:
1. New programming languages.
2. Algorithms and Data Structures (C++ and Rust).
3. Linux management (end user side, Shell script).
4. Game development (Godot).
5. Back-end development (Python/Javascript).

I'm mainly focusing in Rust and C++ at the time.

        I usually don't list my old and bad projects, but this was my first ever GitHub project, I keep it here for the record, wasn't experienced at all in programming but I knew how to colorize output, it's great to look back at it.

        The project I most enjoyed working on (until now), I rewrote the device manager for the DeathAdder 2013 mouse for my DeathAdder White Edition. I needed to reverse engineer the USB communication from Razer Synapse to my mouse, capturing it with WireShark, exporting it into .JSON, and then analysing with Python until I could figure out the bytes and bits patterns in the USBHID communication. This turned out to be very challenging.

        Dotao is my personal project I'm most focused on, it's a WIP DotFiles manager inspired by `stow`, that works very well and is fast.

        Godot is the engine I love the most, I'm trying to start making contributions to it, but it has also been a challenge to deal with the C++ codebase, soon I'll be able to list here what I managed to pull off to the project.

I'm starting to make more contributions to open-source software through GitHub on projects from other people.

Besides the coding, I also did some talks/tutorials at:
- Python Brasil
- GruPy-RN

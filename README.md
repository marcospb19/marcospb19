<!-- Welcome -->
<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/i4aFkdF.png" height="54px" />  Welcome!</h2>

Hi, my name is Jo√£o Marcos (he/him), I'm 20 and I'm from Brazil.

I'm an IT undergraduate and I plan on getting a major in Computer Science by 2024.

    <!-- Here's a list of topics I like to study in free time:<br>
    1. More programming languages. (Rust)<br>
    2. Algorithms and Data Structures (C++ and Rust).<br>
    3. Linux management (user/dev side, Shell script automation).<br>
    4. Back-end development experiments (Python/Rust/Javascript).<br>
    5. Game dev (Godot Engine).<br>
    <br> -->
    I'm mainly focusing in:<br>
    1. Rust for Unix projects I'm passionate about.<br>
    2. C++ for heavy duty algorithms studying.<br>
    3. Python for back-end.<br>

I did some talks about Python at:
- Python Brasil (National event!)
- GruPy-RN (Local community)

By participating in competitive programming contests (problem solving), me and my trio got the first place in our state twice! (2019 and 2020), wish me luck for the national finals that are coming soon!

I'm a tutor in my college. Not to brag but people often come and say I'm good at teaching, that's something I really like to do, so I'm really proud of it.

I also know Shell Script and really like customizing my Linux system for productivity and appearance.

Here's an intersection of (software I wrote) with (software I like):

Note: I've been really putting effort in projects just recently, so there's a lot of unfinished stuff here.

      This was my first GitHub project ever, just after I started learning C from college plus a book, it's funny to look back at the bad code I've written, I hope I'm doing better now.

        I got very hyped when I realized that I could reverse-engineer the Razer proprietary software (capture the USB communication) and hack my mouse! Something I had never thought about before. Really enjoyed making it, turned out to be very challenging.

    <td>
        Expecting Dotao to become big, and I hope I'm right, it's a <b>DotFiles Manager</b> inspired by `stow`, which is a utility that can help you version configs between your personal systems, more useful for people who really like Linux and to customize their own desktop (<a href="https://github.com/marcospb19/dotfiles">like me</a>).

      Well, I didn't found a <i>crate</i> to ask for file permissions beforehand in Rust, so I just made it.

      Aaaaaawesome rust macros, I've putten effort on trying to perfect the README and improve the documentation.

        Godot is the engine I love the most, I'm trying to start making contributions to it, but it has also been a challenge to deal with the C++ codebase, soon I'll be able to list here what I managed to pull off to the project.

<!-- Welcome -->
<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/drB0jSb.png" height="54px" />  Welcome!</h2>

Hey! I'm **João Marcos**, a 23-year-old Rustacean from Brazil 🇧🇷.

Check out my blog at [marcos.unsafe.rs](https://marcos.unsafe.rs).

I've always been obsessed with programming, so now I'm on a career break to "reset".

<!-- Projects -->

<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/ekBkvJA.png" height="54px" />  My projects</h2>

### The ones people actually use:

<table style="max-width: 100%; white-space: nowrap;">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/ouch-org/ouch">Ouch (1.9k ⭐️)</a></td>
    <td>🦀</td>
    <td>
      Easiest tool for (de)compressing stuff via CLI. Shipped to Arch, Manjaro, and more.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/marcospb19/permissions">Permissions</a></td>
    <td>🦀</td>
    <td>
       Small crate with 34k+ downloads to check for file permissions.

    <td>🦀</td>
    <td>
      I'm now the maintainer of <code>cargo-sweep</code>, a <code>target/</code> cleaning tool with around 280k downloads.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### The cool ones (IMO):

<table style="max-width: 100%; white-space: nowrap;">
  <tr>

       Deathadder controller reverse-engineered from Razer's proprietary and <b>closed-source</b> software.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/marcospb19/fs-tree">Fs-tree</a></td>

    <td>🦀</td>
    <td>
       (WIP) A simple dotfiles manager that is a superset of <code>stow</code>.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Experiments on building a programming language:

1. [`lox`] 🦀 - First hand-written Lexer, Parser, AST, and basic interpreter.
2. [`cocoa`] 🦀 - Now using convenient Lexer and Parser libs, more interpreter experiments.
3. [`sushi`] 🦀 - Retrying `Cocoa`, but with good error reporting.
4. [`mini-c`] 🦀 - My first tiny LLVM-IR compiler! It _"works"_! (kinda)

### More Rust experiment projects:

- [`Marquito`] 🦀 - An HTTP/1.1 server hand-written in Rust that handles 90k+ requests per second (pair programmed).
- [`tila`] 🦀 - A Xorg keylogger to feed keyboard layout analyzers (I was considering switching to Colemak).

### C
- [`projeto-itp`] - An interactive CLI relational database (Portuguese README).
- [`loadingnewyear`] - My first ever project, draws a colored year progress in the terminal.

### C++
- [`icpc-training`] - Some of the advanced algorithms I studied for ICPC.

### Misc
- [`dotfiles`] - Personal dotfiles.

<!-- Random facts about me -->
<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/myYgqBu.png" height="54px" />  Random facts about me</h2>

1. I have 7 cats, in Brazil we say that cats have 7 lives instead of 9. 🐱 (idk why)
2. My dream is to work on a cool open source text editor or programming language in the future.
3. If my name were to be translated, I'd be called "John Marks Pear Tree Heifer". 🧐 (wtf)
4. Aaaand I'd probably _beat your ass_ at _table tennis_ 🏓.

<!-- Programming games I like -->
<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/Y65KVTs.png" height="54px" />  Games I like</h2>

Some programming/engineering games I recommend:

1. [`Factorio`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/) (factory building).
2. [`Logic World`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1054340/Logic_World/) (circuit building).
3. [`MHRD`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/576030/MHRD/) (build a computer).
4. [`Exapunks`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/716490/EXAPUNKS/) (robot scripting).
5. [`Shenzhen I/O`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/) (assembly).
6. [`TIS-100`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/) (very primitive assembly).

All games are Turing complete, but 3-6 all have script size limitations.

Hi, my name is João Marcos (he/him), I'm 19 and I'm from Brazil.

I'm an IT undergraduate and I plan on getting a major college degree by 2025 in Computer Science.

<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/ekBkvJA.png" height="54px" />  Studies</h2>

Here's a list of topics I like to study in free time:
1. New programming languages.
2. Algorithms and Data Structures (C++ and Rust).
3. Linux management (end user side, Shell script).
4. Game development (Godot).
5. Back-end development (Python/Javascript).

I'm mainly focusing in Rust and C++ at the time.

        This colored loading bar was one of my first projects ever, I only knew the basics of C programming and how to colorize text output.

        DotMan is the project I'm currently focusing on, it's supposed to be a DotFiles manager that works well, inspired by `stow`.

        A recent project, I rewrote the device manager for the DeathAdder 2013 mouse for my DeathAdder White Edition mouse. I needed to reverse engineer the USB communication from Razer Synapse to my mouse, capturing it with WireShark, exporting it into .JSON, and then analysing with Python until I could figure out the bytes patterns in the communication.

I'm starting to make more contributions to open-source software through GitHub on projects from other people.

Besides the coding, I also did some talks/tutorials at:
- Python Brasil
- GruPy-RN

### Experiments in building a programming language:

1. [`lox`] ü¶Ä - First hand-written Lexer, Parser, AST, and basic interpreter.
2. [`cocoa`] ü¶Ä - Experimenting with convenient Lexer and Parser libs, more interpreter experiments.
3. [`sushi`] ü¶Ä - Retrying `Cocoa`, but with good error reporting (sub-experiment: UI-tests driven development).
4. [`mini-c`] ü¶Ä - My first tiny LLVM-IR compiler! For a minuscule subset of C.

### HTTP server experiments:

- [`Marquito`] ü¶Ä - An HTTP/1.1 server hand-written in Rust that handles 90k+ requests per second.
- [`balu`] ü¶Ä - A single-thread and blocking HTTP server API.

### C

- [`projeto-itp`] - A non-SQL CLI-interactive relational database for a college project (Portuguese README).
- [`loadingnewyear`] - My first-ever project, draws a colored year progress in the terminal (lol).

### C++

- [`icpc-training`] - Some of the advanced algorithms I studied for ICPC (programming contests).

### Misc

- [`dotfiles`] - Personal dotfiles, managed with [`dotin`] (my own dotfiles manager).

3. Daily, on average, I listen to music for 5 hours. üéß
4. I once solved a Rubik's cube blindfolded, but it took 10 minutes (it's a little easier when you can see).
5. If my name were to be translated, I'd be called "John Marks Pear Tree Heifer". üßê (wtf)

<!-- Programming games I like -->
<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/Y65KVTs.png" height="54px" />  Games I like</h2>

Some programming/engineering games:

1. [`Factorio`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/) (factory building)
2. [`Exapunks`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/716490/EXAPUNKS/) (_"robot"_ scripting)
3. [`MHRD`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/576030/MHRD/) (build a computer)
4. [`Logic World`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1054340/Logic_World/) (circuit building)
5. [`TIS-100`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/) (very primitive assembly)
6. [`Shenzhen I/O`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/) (assembly)
7. [`The Signal State`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1577620/The_Signal_State/) (program with modular synthesizers)

All of the above are Turing Complete, but if you really want to build a computer, go for `MHRD` or `Logic World`.

And, some non-engineering games:

1. [`Chants of Sennaar`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931770/Chants_of_Sennaar/) (translation and puzzles)
2. [`Hollow Knight`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/)
3. [`Outer Wilds`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/)
4. [`Sable`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/757310/Sable/)
5. [`Dark Souls`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570940/DARK_SOULS_REMASTERED/)
6. [`Fallout: New Vegas`](https://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/Fallout_New_Vegas/) (cool RPG)

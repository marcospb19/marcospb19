<!-- Welcome -->
<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/i4aFkdF.png" height="54px" />  Welcome!</h2>

Hi, my name is João Marcos (he/him), I'm 19 and I'm from Brazil.

I'm an IT undergraduate and I plan on getting a major college degree by 2025 in Computer Science.

<!-- Study -->
<h2 align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.imgur.com/ekBkvJA.png" height="54px" />  Studies</h2>

Here's a list of topics I like to study in free time:
1. New programming languages.
2. Algorithms and Data Structures (C++ and Rust).
3. Linux management (end user side, Shell script).
4. Game development (Godot).
5. Back-end development (Python/Javascript).

I'm mainly focusing in Rust and C++ at the time.

This section is a poor **scratch** that will change soon (a month or so).

    <td>
        This colored loading bar was one of my first projects ever, I only knew the basics of C programming and how to colorize text output.

    <td>
        DotMan is the project I'm currently focusing on, it's supposed to be a DotFiles manager that works well, inspired by `stow`.
    </td>
  </tr>

    <td>
        An abandoned project, but I think about resuming the development, it's a git helper that would help you with cloning, URLs, and listing repositories within the terminal.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

I'm starting to make more contributions to open-source software through GitHub on projects from other people.

Besides the coding, I also did some talks/tutorials at:
- Python Brasil
- GruPy-RN
